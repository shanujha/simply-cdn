# Simply-CDN

This project came out of the idea, that there were not simple cdn setups using NodeJS and ExpressJS

Yeah, yeah, there were tutorials and articles on hosting static files, but, that meant, doing the same thing again and again.


# How to use

- Install Deps

      $ npm i 

- Change Port (optional)

    Open `.env` and change PORT value as you see fit. Default is 23657

- Start Server

      $ npm start

- Access in browser

    Open localhost:23657 in the browser of your liking.
    Change `23657` to PORT value in `.env` if you had changed it in the earlier step.

- Profit?

        Profit?

## LEGAL, LICENSE, yada, yada...

I just made this for myself, hoping that I don't have to redo everything, whenever I wanted a simple cdn.

I guess I did it.

If you USE it, use it WITHOUT any guarantee, OK?
Don't get it from somewhere else. I don't think I can handle any lawsuits right now...

All right, best of luck to you, developer!
